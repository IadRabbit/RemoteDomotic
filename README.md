# RemoteDomotic

## Story
	This repository contain the project I needed to realize & present to the examination board in June 2021. This is one of my favourite project I ever made that made me spark during my exam. The board (my teachers included) was very happy to see such project made by one of their pupils. Theoretically the max score I could achieve was 99/100, but gave the success of my presentation (I think helped also presenting it in english instead of italian). I achieved & fulfilled by high school with 100/100. Wonderful.

## Currently
	I wanted to publish this project on GitHub long time ago, but never found the time for writing a proper README.
	The original configuration is a bit more intricate, for this I realized a Docker Compose file (working only for linux due some audio stuff) that deploy faster the webapp & webserver. Instead of manually transfer folders & fixing possible webserver configuration & enviroment configs.

## Configuration
```bash
git clone https://github.com/iadrabbit/RemoteDomotic
```
